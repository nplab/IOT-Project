# Arduino Examples
These Arduino examples use the [Arduino API](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/) and are optimized for the [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/).

To install the PlatformIO IDE, install [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) first.
The PlatformIO IDE is installed as an extension, as shown in the [official docs](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode).
Beginners should read and follow the [quick-start guide](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html#quick-start).

The examples should also work within the Arduino IDE, additional variable/define declaration may be necessary.
